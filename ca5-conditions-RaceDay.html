    /*
    Here’s how our registration works. There are adult runners (over 18 years of age) and youth runners (under 18 years of age). They can register early or late. Runners are assigned a race number and start time based on their age and registration.

    Race number:
    -Early adults receive a race number at or above 1000.
    -All others receive a number below 1000.
    
    Start time:
    -Adult registrants run at 9:30 am or 11:00 am.
    -Early adults run at 9:30 am.
    -Late adults run at 11:00 am.
    -Youth registrants run at 12:30 pm (regardless of registration).

    But we didn’t plan for runners that are exactly 18! We’ll handle that by the end of the project.
